This project includes a "Map" template for an associative container and an "Employee" class for managing employee data. The "Map" template handles duplicate keys and searches for non-existent keys, all defined in Map.h as required for template implementations.

Usage examples include a library database where the key is the book title, and the value stores the author, category, page count, and status (on the shelf/borrowed). Tests cover special cases like duplicate keys and missing keys. Only std::string from the C++ standard library is used.
